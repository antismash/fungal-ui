  <strong>Server move after outage</strong><br>
  Dear fungiSMASH users. On 2019-03-29 our old fungiSMASH site died.
  In order to restore the service, we have moved the website to the same servers running bacterial antiSMASH.
  To keep the load manageable until we can buy some new servers, we have disabled CPU intensive analyses like
  CASSIS for the time being.<br>
  We apologise for the inconvenience, the antiSMASH team.
