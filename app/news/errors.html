  <strong>Server move after outage</strong><br>
  Dear fungiSMASH users. On 2019-03-29 our old fungiSMASH site died.
  In order to restore the service, we have moved the website to the same servers running bacterial antiSMASH.
  To keep the load manageable until we can buy some new servers, we have disabled CPU intensive analyses like
  CASSIS for the time being.<br>
  We apologise for the inconvenience, the antiSMASH team.

  <strong>Thanks for your support</strong><br>
  Last week we asked for some letters of support for a grant submission.
  We were overwhelmed with how many people reached out and sent letters.<br>
  Thanks a lot from the whole team!
